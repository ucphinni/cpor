# Task 2 Completion Assessment: Crypto and Test Typing

## Date: July 5, 2025

### Summary
- All cryptography helpers (Ed25519, nonce, TPM stub, key management) are implemented, type-safe, and spec-aligned.
- All message schemas and serialization logic are fully spec-aligned and validated.
- All test fixtures and test functions have explicit type annotations.
- All test and validation scripts are PEP8 and mypy compliant.
- All unused variables and imports have been removed or replaced with `_`.
- Validation scripts are now located under `tests/validate/` as per project conventions.
- Lessons learned and instructions have been updated in the `docs/` directory.

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 3: Configuration Management, following the same strict type and test hygiene.
- Continue to keep all test and validation logic under `tests/`.
- Update documentation and lessons learned after each major task.

**Status:**
Task 2 is complete and the codebase is ready for the next phase.
