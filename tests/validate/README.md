# Validation Scripts

This directory contains protocol validation and spec-alignment scripts for the CPOR project.

- Place all `validate_*.py` scripts here.
- These scripts are for protocol compliance, message vector checks, and spec-alignment, not for unit or integration tests.

**Examples:**
- `validate_task1.py`
- `validate_spec_aligned.py`
