# Local CI Setup Complete

Your local Continuous Integration (CI) environment is now set up! Here's what you have:

## Available Scripts

### 1. `./run_tests.sh` - Full Test Suite
- Runs all tests with coverage
- Generates HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/`
- Use this for complete testing

### 2. `./watch_tests.sh` - Automated Testing
- Watches for file changes and runs tests automatically
- Perfect for development - tests run as you code
- Press Ctrl+C to stop
- **This is your main CI automation tool**

### 3. `./quick_coverage.sh` - Quick Check
- Fast coverage check showing just the essentials
- Shows coverage percentage and missing lines
- Good for quick status updates

### 4. `./ci_status.sh` - Status Overview
- Shows current coverage status
- Lists failed tests that need fixing
- Provides next steps for reaching 100% coverage

## How to Use Your CI

### For Active Development:
```bash
./watch_tests.sh
```
This will automatically run tests whenever you change code files.

### For Coverage Reports:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # View detailed coverage in browser
```

### For Quick Status:
```bash
./ci_status.sh
```

## Current Status

- **Coverage**: 85% for `src/cpor/messages.py`
- **Issues**: 8 failing tests due to type checking in `from_dict` method
- **Goal**: 100% coverage for `src/cpor/messages.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the failing tests** - The `from_dict` method has issues with subscripted generics (List[str], etc.)
2. **Add tests for uncovered lines** - Use coverage reports to identify missing test cases
3. **Use automated testing** - Run `./watch_tests.sh` while coding for instant feedback

## Benefits of This Setup

- ✅ **Automated**: Tests run automatically when you change files
- ✅ **Fast Feedback**: See test results immediately
- ✅ **Coverage Tracking**: Know exactly what code needs testing
- ✅ **No Manual Intervention**: Everything runs automatically
- ✅ **Local**: No need for external CI services
- ✅ **Lightweight**: Just uses pytest and pytest-watch

Your CI is ready! Start with `./watch_tests.sh` for the best development experience.
